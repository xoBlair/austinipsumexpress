#austin ipsum

Did you recently move back to Brooklyn? Good. Miss Austin much? Aww, sorry, not sorry. 
If you need some filler text or just wanna get weird, Austin Ipsum is the app for YOU! Better than boring old Latin! Better than Hipsum! Austin Ipsum even serves up the weather, do512 tweets, and a SXSW countdown.

#Instructions: 
1. enter the number of sentences you’d like.
2. choose Food themed sentences or Fun (around town) sentences

#Process: 
I originally created this as a static site with just JS, HTML, and CSS. Then, I created an Express app and connected it to MongoDB with the intention of allowing users to create accounts and contribute sentences. I’m almost there, just need to fix up some routes and I think some requirements? Possibly environment variables? Possibly Mongoose?  I'll get there!
